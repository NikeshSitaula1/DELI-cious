## Application Structure

- User Interface to Order: User interface classes will ask for input and store it in the order class. 
Order File Manager would then write the stored content into text file.

- Sandwiches, Drinks and Chips are saved in Items class, as they are extended towards Items with Inheritance. Signature sandwich is extend to Sandwich. 
Topping is not extended, as topping is not a sandwich, rather sandwich has toppings

- Order will collect the Items as list, which would be the main data to write in the Receipt with File Manager.

## Interesting Code

#### for (int i = 0; i < breadOptions.size(); i++) {
#### System.out.printf("   %d - %s%n", i + 1, breadOptions.get(i));
#### }

- A simple but a very effective code to me as I use this code a lot in my capstone. I used List, in this example, breadOptions 
which to print each item. This code loop goes through each index of the breadOptions list, starting from i = 0 and continuing
as long as variable i is less than the size of the list (breadOptions.size()). i++: After each iteration, i increments by 1, moving to 
the next item in the list. It then prints the option i + 1, so it does not start from 0, and gets the current index of i 
from the breadOptions list. If I ever add an item to the list, it will automatically add them and show as an option.
